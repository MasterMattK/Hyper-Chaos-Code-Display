# Hyper-Chaos-Code-Display

This script displays the active hyper chaos effects and their remaining times. It's optional since there's a display built into the game, but the script is better for content creation and simply looks better. 

# Installation
1. First you need to install [python](https://www.python.org/). The script was made with v3.8.10, but newer versions may also work.
2. Download the 2 python scripts as well as requirements.txt provided in this repo.
3. Run the following command in the same directory as requirements.txt: `py -m pip install -r requirements.txt`. This should install all of the necessary dependencies.
4. Run the script with the following command once your instance of Hyper Chaos is already running: `py CodeDisplay.py`. Also make sure you run this command in the same directory as CodeDisplay.py and DolphinMemoryLib.py. The code display should then work automatically as you play.
